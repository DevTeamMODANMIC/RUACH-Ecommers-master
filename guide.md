Improve Vendor Order Performance: Consider restructuring the data model to allow for more efficient vendor order queries, possibly by:
Adding a vendorIds array field to each order document
Creating a separate subcollection for vendor-specific order data
Add Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling for cases where vendor ID might not be properly attached to order items.
Implement Composite Indexes: For production deployment, create the required composite indexes for review queries rather than removing the date sorting.
Overall, the main order functionality appears to be working correctly after the fixes that were implemented. The remaining issues are primarily performance-related and would become more significant as the system scales.
